 * Each plane has n polygons; ultimately plane metadata from @ref locations and @ref vetices is

 * @ref locations stores continuous metadata for each plane:
 * location 1 | location 2 | location 3 | location 4 | ...
 *
 * @ref polygon_info_start_index is a helper array to go from a location entry to a polygon_info entry.
 *
 * @ref polygon_info stores info (metadata) for each polygon, flattened:
 * plane 1 polygon 1 info | plane 1 polygon 2 info | ... | plane 2 polygon 1 info | ...
 *
 * @ref polygon_info.vertices_start_index is a helper array to go from a polygon_info entry to vertices
 * entry.
 *
 * @ref vertices stores vertex data for each polygon, for each plane, flattened:
 * plane 1 polygon 1 vertex 1 | plane 1 polygon 1 vertex 2 | ... | plane 1 polygon 2 vertex 1 | ...
 *
 * To reconstruct the vertices of a certain plane polygon:
 * - Find the index i of the plane with the requested plane_id in the locations array.
 * - Use this index i to generate a new index j = polygon_info_start_index[i].
 * - polygon_info[j] is the info of the first polygon of the locations[i] plane.
 * - polygon_info[j + polygonBufferIndex] is the info of the requested polygon.
 * - polygon_info[j + polygonBufferIndex].vertex_count is the vertex count of this polygon.
 * - polygon_info[j + polygonBufferIndex].vertices_start_index is another new index k.
 * - vertices[k] is the first vertex of the requested polygon.
 *
 * Convention: Whoever writes to this struct checks the size values first and reallocates arrays if necessary.
